# Context Window Optimization Analysis" (30 minutes)
## Setup (5 minutes):
Using the Hugging Face datasets library and a text dataset of your choice:
# Technical Requirements:
## 1. Load a subset of a large text dataset (e.g., Wikipedia articles, books)
Implement basic text chunking with different strategies:
Fixed-length chunks
Sentence-based chunking
Paragraph-based chunking
## 2. Calculate and compare:
Information density per chunk
Semantic coherence between chunks
Context overlap patterns
## 3. Analysis Tasks (20 minutes):
Implement at least two chunking methods
Create metrics to measure chunk quality
Analyze semantic preservation
Compare token efficiency
Document trade-offs between methods
## 4. Present (5 minutes):
Your methodology
Performance comparison
Most interesting finding
Key technical challenges
